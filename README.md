Building <sup>(Complicated)</sup>
---
* In CMake:
    1. Add `ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(lib/discordpp)` before your `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES` command.
    2. Add `discordpp` to your `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES` command.
* In your code:
    1. Add `#include \<discordpp/bot.hh\>`.
    2. Create a Bot object with `Bot(std::string token);`.
    3. Add responses to events with the Bot's `void addResponse(std::string event, std::function<void(Bot *, json)> response);`.
    4. Start the bot object with the Bot's `void start();`.
    * Note: Code run after the Bot's `void start();` will not run until after the Bot stops, which I have not yet written.
